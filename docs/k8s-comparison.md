Kubernetes Distribution Comparison for ERP System
=================================================

This guide compares k3s vs full Kubernetes (kubeadm) to help you choose the best option for your ERP deployment.

Quick Recommendation
-------------------

**For Contabo VPS (4-8GB RAM, single node):** Use **k3s**
**For Multi-node cluster or 16GB+ RAM:** Use **full Kubernetes**
**For Production-critical ERP with growth plans:** Use **full Kubernetes**

Detailed Comparison
-------------------

### k3s (Lightweight Kubernetes)

**Pros:**
✅ **Lower resource usage** (512MB RAM vs 2GB+ for kubeadm)
✅ **Faster installation** (~30 seconds vs 10-15 minutes)
✅ **Single binary** - easy to install and upgrade
✅ **Built-in SQLite** - no etcd needed for single-node
✅ **Perfect for single VPS** deployments
✅ **Auto-configures networking** (Flannel)
✅ **Includes local storage** provisioner
✅ **Traefik ingress** included (though we disable it for NGINX)
✅ **Production-ready** and CNCF certified

**Cons:**
❌ Limited to smaller clusters (recommended max: 10 nodes)
❌ Some advanced features may lag behind upstream
❌ Less community resources/tutorials
❌ Harder to troubleshoot edge cases

**Resource Requirements:**
- Minimum: 512MB RAM, 1 CPU

❌ **Requires external etcd** for HA
❌ **More moving parts** to troubleshoot
❌ **Slower installation** process

**Resource Requirements:**
- Minimum: 2GB RAM, 2 CPUs
- Recommended: 4GB RAM, 2 CPUs (control plane)
- Worker nodes: 2GB+ RAM each
- Disk: ~10GB for system

**Best For:**
- Multi-node clusters
- Production workloads with strict SLAs
- Complex networking requirements
- Teams familiar with Kubernetes
- Long-term enterprise deployments

Recommendation for Your ERP System
----------------------------------

### Current Setup Analysis

**Your Contabo VPS specs (assumed):**
- 4-8GB RAM
- 2-4 vCPUs
- Single node deployment
- Running: ERP API (Django), ERP UI (Vue), PostgreSQL, Redis

**Workload Requirements:**
- ERP API: ~512MB-1GB RAM
- ERP UI: ~256-512MB RAM
- PostgreSQL: ~1-2GB RAM
- Redis: ~256-512MB RAM
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana): ~1-2GB RAM
- **Total:** ~3-6GB RAM for applications

### Decision Matrix

#### Choose **k3s** if:
✅ Your VPS has 4-8GB RAM (Contabo standard VPS)
✅ Single-node deployment is acceptable
✅ You want faster setup and lower overhead
✅ Resource efficiency is a priority
✅ You're comfortable with k3s quirks
✅ This is a small-to-medium business ERP

**Verdict: RECOMMENDED for most Contabo deployments**

#### Choose **full Kubernetes (kubeadm)** if:
✅ Your VPS has 16GB+ RAM (or planning multi-node)
✅ You need high availability (multi-master)
✅ You want 100% upstream compatibility
✅ Team has strong Kubernetes experience
✅ Planning to scale beyond single node
✅ Enterprise-grade SLAs required
✅ Complex networking (multi-tenancy, network policies)

**Verdict: RECOMMENDED for enterprise production**

---

Hybrid Recommendation
--------------------

### Start with k3s, Plan for kubeadm

**Phase 1: Initial Deployment (0-6 months)**
- Deploy on Contabo with k3s
- Lower costs, faster iteration
- Validate workload and scaling needs
- Build operational expertise

**Phase 2: Production Scale (6-12 months)**
If you experience:
- Resource constraints
- Need for high availability
- Multi-node requirements
- Complex networking needs

Then migrate to:
- Larger VPS or multi-node cluster
- Full Kubernetes with kubeadm
- Proper HA setup with load balancers

**Migration Path:**
1. Export all manifests: `kubectl get all -A -o yaml > backup.yaml`
2. Set up kubeadm cluster
3. Install same operators (cert-manager, Prometheus, etc.)
4. Re-apply manifests
5. Update DNS gradually
6. Most ArgoCD/Helm charts work identically on both

Performance Comparison
---------------------

### Resource Overhead (System Components Only)

| Component | k3s | kubeadm |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Control Plane | ~400MB | ~1.5GB |
| Container Runtime | containerd | containerd |
| etcd | SQLite (50MB) | etcd (300MB+) |
| CNI | Flannel (100MB) | Calico (200MB+) |
| **Total System** | **~500-600MB** | **~2GB+** |

**Available for Apps:**
- 4GB VPS: k3s = ~3.4GB, kubeadm = ~2GB
- 8GB VPS: k3s = ~7.4GB, kubeadm = ~6GB

### Startup Time

- k3s: ~30 seconds to running cluster
- kubeadm: ~10-15 minutes including CNI setup

---

Production Readiness
-------------------

Final Recommendation
-------------------

### For Your ERP System on Contabo VPS

**Use k3s because:**

1. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Leaves more RAM for your ERP applications
   - Lower CPU overhead = better app performance
   - Smaller disk footprint

2. **Simpler Operations**
   - Single command installation
   - Easier troubleshooting
   - Faster disaster recovery
   - One-line upgrades

3. **Perfect for Single Node**
   - Built-in storage provisioner
   - No external dependencies
   - SQLite for single-node is fine

4. **Cost-Effective**
   - Can run on smaller VPS tier
   - Save €10-20/month on hosting
   - Reinvest in application resources

5. **Production Ready**
   - CNCF certified
   - Used by thousands of production deployments
   - Well-tested and stable

### When to Migrate to kubeadm

Consider migration when you need:
- **Multiple nodes** (horizontal scaling)
- **High availability** (multi-master)
- **16GB+ RAM** available
- **Enterprise SLAs** with strict uptime requirements
- **Complex networking** (network policies, service mesh)
- **Team preference** for vanilla Kubernetes

---

Implementation
--------------

I've provided installation scripts for both options:

- **k3s:** `docs/contabo-setup.md` (current default)
- **kubeadm:** `docs/contabo-setup-kubeadm.md` (new, alternative)

Both work with the same:
- Helm charts
- Argo CD applications
- Monitoring stack
- CI/CD pipelines

Choose the approach that fits your needs!

Need Help Deciding?
-------------------

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# Check available RAM on your VPS
free -h

# If "available" is < 3GB → use k3s
# If "available" is > 6GB → either works, k3s still recommended for simplicity
# If planning multi-node → use kubeadm
```

**Questions to Consider:**
1. Do you plan to add more nodes in next 12 months? → kubeadm
2. Is resource efficiency critical? → k3s
3. Team experienced with vanilla K8s? → kubeadm
4. Want fastest setup and simplest ops? → k3s
5. Need 99.99% uptime? → kubeadm (multi-master)

**Still unsure?** Start with k3s. It's easier to migrate from k3s → kubeadm than the reverse, and you might never need to!
